Info about Gerber cutter NC codes
=================================

For reference, in NC code, "n" denotes a numeral.


See "GERBER.pdf" for a list of NC codes. In files generated by the Gerber
software, I also see the G02 command in the form G02XnnnnYnnnnInnnnJnnnn.
According to data found on the internet this should be clockwise circular
interpolation. G03 should be counter-clockwise circular interpolation.


It seems that our controller outputs a new piece code Nn every 200 commands
or so.
