Gerber NC code
==============

For reference, in NC code, "n" denotes a numeral.


See "GERBER.pdf" for a list of NC codes. In files generated by the Gerber
software, I also see the G02 command in the form G02XnnnnYnnnnInnnnJnnnn.
According to data found on the internet this should be clockwise circular
interpolation. G03 should be counter-clockwise circular interpolation.


It seems that our controller outputs a new piece code Nn every 200 commands
or so.

Entities in different kinds of files
====================================

+------+--------------+-------------+------------------------+
|      | DXF          | NC          | PDF                    |
+======+==============+=============+========================+
|Line: | start, end   | (curr,) end | (curr,) end            |
+------+--------------+-------------+------------------------+
|Arc:  | center, R,   | (curr,) end | center, radius,        |
|      | start angle, | center      | start angle, end angle |
|      | end angle    | or approx.  | (always CCW)           |
|      | (always      | by lines    |                        |
|      | CCW)         |             |                        |
+------+--------------+-------------+------------------------+


So we define two kind of entities:
  - lines from start point to end point
  - arcs from start point to end point with a center (also contains radius and
    angles
