.Nd Extract

and

entities from a 
.Tn DXF
file and arranges them in a way suitable for optimized
cutting.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
infile(s)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents version 
.Ql VERSION
of the 
.Nm
program. 

The cutworks software that comes with a gerber cutter doesn't automatically
optimize the cutting paths it reads from 
.Tn DXF
files. It essentially cuts lines
in the order it finds them in the 
.Tn DXF
file.

This program reads a 
.Tn DXF
file. The name of the file must end in '.dxf' or '.DXF', otherwise the program
will report an error and quit. It extracts all the 
.Ql LINE 
and 
.Ql ARC
entities from it. It then searches through all these entities and assembles
connected entities into lists called contours. If necessary, the direction of
entities in a contour is changed so that all entities can be cut in one
continuous movement.

These contours and any remaining lines and arcs are then sorted in ascending
order of the left-bottom corner of their bounding box.

It also converts arcs into line segments. By default these line segments are
no more than 5 units in length. It ignores the
.Dv $MEASUREMENT
variable in the dxf file, because that is often not set correctly.

The output is written to a new file. The name of the new file is based on the
name of the old file, with a trailing number added or increased. So 'foo.dxf'
becomes 'foo1.dxf' and 'test 17.dxf' becomes 'test 18.dxf'.

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The 
.Nm
program requires the Python interpreter. It was written for version 2.7, but
should be able to work with 3.x after fixing with
.Xr 2to3 .

.Sh HISTORY
This program was written to stop having to fix up DXF files manually before
loading them into cutworks.
