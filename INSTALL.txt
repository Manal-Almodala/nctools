Installation on Windows
=======================

- First install the Python interpreter, e.g. version 2.7.x and make sure that
  it works.
- Make sure that the Python directory and the scripts directory in is the
  path; Under XP, go to My Computer, right-click and select Properties. In the
  dialog box select the Avanced tab and click on the Environment Variables
  button. In the system variable Path, you should see two paths, for the
  Python interpreter and for installed scripts. It should look like this:
  ";C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts" (for Python version 2.7.x). If you don't
  see them, add them.
- In the distribution directory, run 'setup.py install' from a cmd.exe window.
