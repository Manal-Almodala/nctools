Installation on Windows
=======================

- First install the Python interpreter, e.g. version 2.7.x and make sure that
  it works.
- In the distribution directory, run 'setup.py install'
- Go to the Scripts subdirectory of the Python distribution
  (e.g. C:\Python27\Scripts), and change the script 'dxfgerber' to
  'dxfgerber.py', to help Python find it.
- Add this script directory to the 'Path' enviroment variable. Under XP, go to
  My Computer, right-click and select Properties. In the dialog box select the
  Avanced tab and click on the Environment Variables button. In the system
  variable Path, you should see the path for the Python interpreter,
  e.g. C:\Python27. Add a semicolon, and then C:\Python27\Scripts.

Installation on UNIX/Linux
